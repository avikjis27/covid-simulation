# Covid-19 toy simulation

To energize myself in this difficult time what could a better way than to use your limited skill to simulate the global crisis in your own laptop. Here is that - 

To run the simulation type  below command. 
```
python3 simulation.py <grid_length> <days_to_observe> <random_seed_value>
```
Example 
```
python3 simulation.py 40 60 100

```
- **In the top left image:** Black dots are either not infected or recovered and white dots are infected.
- **In the top right image:** Black dots are not infected, white dots are recovered and gray dots are deceased.
- **In the down left graph:** Shows the aggregate data
- **In the down right graph:** Shows day wise data
